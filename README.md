# Mazes

This project contains an elixir version of the code and projects listed in the book [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers/)
by Jamis Buck. The book is mostly complete with the exception being a few of the 3d mazes in the last chapter.

TODO:
* Reorganize code so not everything is in the lib file. For example, have a grids file, cells file, algorithms file etc
* A lot of the grids do not support color for the background
* Use protocols or some better way to handle the "inheritence" that I did throughout the book
* Make a Phoenix app to show the different algorithms and grids.
* Provide examples in the README
