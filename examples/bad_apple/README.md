# Bad Apple

This example is [Bad Apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8) but each frame is a randomly generated perfect maze. The maze for every frame
was made using a [modified recursive backtracking algorithm](https://github.com/CoreyBabs/mazes/blob/main/lib/modified_recursive_backtracker.ex). The
modifications to the traditional recursive backtracking algorithm were to make it so the algorithm could work on non connected areas of a mask.
